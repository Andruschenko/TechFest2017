# Virtual Sign Language Learning Environment

## About

A 3D Mixed Reality Experience for the [Microsoft HoloLense](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens) to learn sign language.

Learning a new sign is as easy as 1-2-3:

As in the video 1) the sign is demonstrated by the avatar, 2) demonstrated from your own perspective by the hands of the avatar and 3) repeated by the learner.

<div align="center">
  <img src="doc/hello.gif" width="420" alt="Hello">
  <div><span style="font-weight: bold">"Hello"</span> gesture</div>
</div>

### Motivation

YouTube videos can be misleading or error-prone when learning sign language because you always see the instructors hands back-to-front. 

Therefore we created a mixed reality environment in which an avatar not only stands in front of you demonstrating the gesture, but also **moves his arms exactly there where your arms should go**. Now you can just repeat the movement the avatar did.

### Facts

* âœ… Interaction with friendly avatar.
* âœ… Shows gestures from your own perspective.
* FutureðŸ”®: Checks your hand-position with a kinect or a laser to check whether you did it right and to correct your mistakes.

## Further Example

How the sign for **"What's up?"** is learned:

<div align="center">
  <img src="doc/whatsup.gif" width="420" alt="Whatsup">
  <div><span style="font-weight: bold">"What's up?"</span> gesture</div>
</div>
